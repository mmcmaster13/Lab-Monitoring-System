# Lab-Monitoring-System

Optical systems often have numerous components whose proper functioning is essential to the health of the system as a whole. Without a convenient way to check the status of these components, troubleshooting any problems with the system can be extremely inefficient, which could put expensive components at risk. This repository includes the code that makes up a low-cost, quick-to-implement solution to this problem, which we've called the "Lab Monitoring System".

Our iteration of the Lab Monitoring System can be best represented by the following system diagram:
